## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Node.js

My learning was focused on the manipulation of date objects. A horoscope was the perfect oppurtunity to practice conversion between date types.

## Optimizations

Making the app more visualy pleasing. It is simple by nature but because of that simplicity I can make it into something more interesting.

## Lessons Learned:

More practice on utilizing expression and practice with node.js
